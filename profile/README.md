MvDevsUnion is a community-driven union focused on protecting privacy, accountability, and worker rights in the Maldivian.

## Why We Exist

Technology is advancing faster than legislation can keep up. This gap creates real risks for privacy, job security, and public understanding. We believe developers have a responsibility to help make technology safer, clearer, and more accessible for non-technical users.

MvDevsUnion exists to bridge that gap by advocating for responsible technology use and empowering people to speak up without fear.

## Who We Are For

MvDevsUnion is open to **everyone**.

You do not need to be a developer to join. Anyone who cares about worker rights, privacy, and responsible technology can contribute their skills, experience, or perspective.

## Core Values

* **Privacy** – Data protection and user safety come first
* **Accountability** – Transparency from both institutions and technology builders

## Scope

Our focus is **Maldives only**. We work specifically on issues that affect Maldivians, local workers, and local digital systems.

## What We Do

* Lobby and advocate for stronger data protection and digital rights
* Build apps and tools that help citizens understand issues and report problems more easily
* Create open platforms that encourage transparency and civic awareness

## Project Philosophy

We are open to ideas.

Any project can be pitched and opened for discussion. If it aligns with our values and benefits Maldivians, it belongs here.

## How to Contribute

* **Developers** can contribute by fixing bugs, improving features, or building new tools
* **Non-developers** can contribute by reporting issues, sharing feedback, and highlighting real-world problems

Every contribution matters.

## Governance

MvDevsUnion is currently represented and led by **Fishie**, who acts as the union’s main representative and lobbyist. Governance is intentionally lightweight and trust-based.

## Public Stance

Our primary and non-negotiable goal is ensuring **strong data protection for Maldivians**.

## What Success Looks Like

Success is measured by our members.

We want developers to feel empowered, protected, and unafraid to speak up without the fear of losing their jobs for doing the right thing.
